Huaweiâ€™s mobile phones demonstrate their proficiency in design at a surface level.

We will work together help the company think about design as not being something that operates at a surface level,  but as something  that must be done holistically using a bottom-up process

We will work together to change the design processappreciate the value of design at Huawei, help them understand that design is more than surface and has to be thought of holistically using a bottom-up process.

(H aare already good at surface design, need to help them think holistically)
